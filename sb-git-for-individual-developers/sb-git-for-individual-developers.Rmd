### What you Need for this Lesson

1. An open terminal window like this one:  

```{r github, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 3}
knitr::include_graphics("www/terminal.png", 
                          auto_pdf = getOption("knitr.graphics.auto_pdf", 
                                                FALSE), dpi = NULL)
```

2. Data, which I have loaded for you in the tibble `scores`. Type `scores` and run the code to see what's in it. 

```{r scores-see-ha-ha, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 5}

```
```{r scores-see-ha-ha-solution}
scores
```


We'll use your terminal window and the data to work through some `git` basics.


## `git init`: Make a New Repoo

1. Place yourself in a directory where you can create another directory that you'll make into a `git` "repository" or, as many people say, "repo." I like to put all my repos in the folder `GitHub`, which resides in `Documents` on my computer. 

```{r myterminal, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("www/github.png", 
                          auto_pdf = getOption("knitr.graphics.auto_pdf", 
                                                FALSE), dpi = NULL)
```

From your terminal window, create a directory called `scores` and navigate into it. It should be empty.

```{r mkdir, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("www/mkdir.png", 
                          auto_pdf = getOption("knitr.graphics.auto_pdf", 
                                                FALSE), dpi = NULL)
```

Now execute two `git` commands:

1. `git init`    
2. `git add .`

The dot is a true dot, not a period at the end of a sentence.

Then see what's in the directory. Specifically, look for the directory `.git`. 

3. `ls` 
4. `ls *.git`

```{r gitinitgitadd, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("www/gitinitgitadd.png", 
                          auto_pdf = getOption("knitr.graphics.auto_pdf", 
                                                FALSE), dpi = NULL)
```

An empty directory, right? `cd` into `.git` just to see if you can. 

```{r finditanyway, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("www/finditanyway.png", 
                          auto_pdf = getOption("knitr.graphics.auto_pdf", 
                                                FALSE), dpi = NULL)
```

Of course you can. 

Now let's go back into RStudio. Save `scores` as "scores.csv" in your lovely new repo using the command `write.csv(scores, "/your_path_here/scores.csv")`.

Now you have a repo that has something in it. Cool!

I have a really cool terminal setup called [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com). The prompt changes to include not only my directory's name, but also the fact that I'm in a `git` repo, which branch of the repo I'm currently using (the `master` branch---and more about branches later), and whether or not I have uncommitted material in the repo (see the ex?).  

```{r iTerm2, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("www/iTerm2.png", 
                          auto_pdf = getOption("knitr.graphics.auto_pdf", 
                                                FALSE), dpi = NA)
```
