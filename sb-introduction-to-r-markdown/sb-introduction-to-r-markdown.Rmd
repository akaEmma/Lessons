## Why?

Why does everybody who uses R Markdown rave about it? 

From Garret Grolemund,

>R Markdown documents implement Donald’s Knuth’s idea of literate programming and take the manual labor out of writing and maintaining reports. Moreover, they are quick to learn. (2015)

To learn more about why rave about RMarkdown, [check out the RMardown website](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) or [see samples of some of the things you can do with RMarkdown in this gallery](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/gallery.html).
