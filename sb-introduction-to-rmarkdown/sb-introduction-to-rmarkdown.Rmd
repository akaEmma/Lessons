## Why?

Why does everybody who uses RMarkdown rave about it? From Garret Grolemund,

>R Markdown documents implement Donald’s Knuth’s idea of literate programming and take the manual labor out of writing and maintaining reports. Moreover, they are quick to learn. (2015)

To learn more about why people use it, [check out the RMardown website](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) or [see samples of some of the things you can do with RMarkdown in this gallery](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/gallery.html).
