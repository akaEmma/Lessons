## We Shamelessly Link you to Someone Else's Work

Daniel Smilkov and Shan Carter continued many people’s previous work (most notably Andrej Karpathy’s convnet.js demo and Chris Olah’s articles about neural networks) to create an online playground where you can learn about and play with neural nets. 

Continuing a proud tradition of helping you benefit from other people's amazing work, [we happily link you to this playground so you can begin to learn about neural nets](http://playground.tensorflow.org/#activation=tanh&batchSize=10&dataset=circle&regDataset=reg-plane&learningRate=0.03&regularizationRate=0&noise=0&networkShape=4,2&seed=0.08968&showTestData=false&discretize=false&percTrainData=50&x=true&y=true&xTimesY=false&xSquared=false&ySquared=false&cosX=false&sinX=false&cosY=false&sinY=false&collectStats=false&problem=classification&initZero=false&hideText=false) by having fun with them. 

Many thanks to Daniel Smilkov, Shan Carter, Andrej Karpathy, Chris Olah, D. Sculley, Fernanda Viégas, and Martin Wattenberg for their amazing work and for choosing an [Apache license](https://github.com/tensorflow/playground/blob/master/LICENSE) that lets us all freely make use of said contributions.
